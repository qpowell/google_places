The office locates at a very strategic place - in CBD and has wonderful view over the harbor. Really enjoy having lunch outside to enjoy the wind and fresh air for inspiration (but watch out for flying dishes because of strong wind). However, food is kinda lack of the variety comparing to other offices. The plus is food station is almost everywhere which feed you very well (be careful of gaining so much weight). There will usually be surprise when you work here: Ice Cream, Nexus 7, Chrome notebook, Nexus and many other swags. There are a lot of trees inside the building which I really like it - so fresh !",

For the last 2 years my website has had a penalty from Google and my site is completely out from Google results. However, I have not forgotten the business I've received in the prior 4 years to the penalty, Google has helped my business grow from being self-employed to a business that now employees over 20 people. Before I started advertising on Google, I used the local paper and the yellow pages in doing this I lost a lot of money. I hope my website comes back one day to Google results, if not I would still like to say a BIG thank-you to Google for what you have made my business today. I highly recommend to any small business to advertise this way though Google as I have had nothing but great results.  ",

For the last 2 years my website has had a penalty from Google and my site is completely out from Google results. However, I have not forgotten the business I've received in the prior 4 years to the penalty, Google has helped my business grow from being self-employed to a business that now employees over 20 people. Before I started advertising on Google, I used the local paper and the yellow pages in doing this I lost a lot of money. I hope my website comes back one day to Google results, if not I would still like to say a BIG thank-you to Google for what you have made my business today. I highly recommend to any small business to advertise this way though Google as I have had nothing but great results.  ",
